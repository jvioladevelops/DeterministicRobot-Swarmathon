## WHAT IS IT?

This is the milestone four project, that uses the breadth first search and depth first search algorithms to traverse the planet.

Code for both algorithms is called when "robot control" is pressed, when all rocks have been collected, robots return to base. 


## HOW TO USE IT

## THINGS TO NOTICE

Sliders, pen up and pen down feature.
